To Build an Options Chain tool given the various input
Goal is to process the market data and calculate Implied volatility (IV), etc. and display as an options chain screen (e.g. https://www.nseindia.com/option-chain ) as a webpage. The following points should be catered.

Highlight the "in the money" options and "out of money" options differently as shown in above example.
There must be a selection of underlying and different expiries.
The options chain should work in real-time. As the market data changes, the fields should be recalculated and refreshed on screen without having to reload on the browser.
