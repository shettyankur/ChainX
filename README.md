# ChainX


A webpage developed to process the market data and calculate Implied volatility (IV), etc. and display as an options chain screen (e.g. https://www.nseindia.com/option-chain ). The following goals have been catered.

"In the money" options and "out of money" options have been highlighted differently.
There is a selection of underlying and different expiries.
The options chain works in real-time. As the market data changes, the fields are recalculated and refreshed on screen without having to reload on the browser.
